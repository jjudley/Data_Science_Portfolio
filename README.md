Portfolio of projects



 Netflix contains over 12,000 unique titles comprising of Movies and TV Shows. Since Netflix is subscription based, and has a desire to keep it's subscribers and create new ones, they often change the titles that are available on the platform on a monthly basis. I want to see if I could accurately predict Netflix titles for the upcoming month with machine learning algorithms. By web scraping information from IMDb's website, I hope to observe factors that could influence their decision.
